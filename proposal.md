The general concept behind my game is taking the roguelike genre and mixing in mechanics from another game. For me, I wish to use similar mechanics to a popular block puzzle game. The core mechanics gameplay uses those mechanics of placing blocks and clearing lines to gain points to progress to the next level. The roguelike functionality comes from different specialty blocks you are able to collect in between levels that amplify those core mechanics to allow the player to have a different but still fun playthrough every time.

Inspirations:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris
- The simple core mechanics of this game have surely inspired main gameplay mechanics in my game.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro_(video_game)
- Balatro is of course another roguelike with other elements from other games and was an inspiration for the main concept behind the game. I also wish to borrow/create juice from Balatro for my game, since I think the juice of the game will be very important to make it feel right.
